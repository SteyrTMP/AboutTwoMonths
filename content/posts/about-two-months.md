In 1955, researchers at Dartmouth College proposed a conference on "Artificial Intelligence", and this conference is widely regarded as the birthplace of the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

The proposal was to "proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."

At the time, it was assumed that making a computer think like a human would be a fairly trivial sort of thing to do. They estimated that they could probably make significant advances in accomplishing this in about 2 months, given 10 researchers.

They were slightly off in their prediction. At the time of writing this, it's been about 63 years and counting.

This blog is a project to document all the little technical things that I'm doing. It occured to me a while back that I should probably keep track of all the odd little projects I do, to serve as a portfolio of work for the purpose of getting a job at Google.

In the spirit of those researchers at Dartmouth, now widely regarded as the founders of the field of AI, I'm going to estimate that I should be able to land myself a job at Google in about 2 months.
